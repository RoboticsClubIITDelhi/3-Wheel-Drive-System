Until 27-05-25:
- Done basic disassembly and finalised 3 wheel drive system design without deadwheels
- Controlled motors with Cytron MDD10A with arduino and Remote control
- Applied PID controller to control speed precisely for a single motor using Cytron
- Started work on shifting to Sabertooth motor driver (2x32) and Kangaroo motion controller (x2)
Until 01-06-25:
- Controlling all three motors simultaneously with a remote and Arduino Mega.
- Testing with power supply done but with battery remains.
