## ü§ñ Project Overview

This repository houses the codebase for the **3 Wheel Drive System with Odometry**. It serves as a comprehensive collection of resources including code, CAD models, calculations, and component datasheets. Our aim is to create a well-documented reference that will enable future teams to build upon our work.

### üéØ Design Goals
- ‚úÖ Good design (with proper deadwheels)
- ‚úÖ Efficient movement capabilities
- ‚úÖ Precise odometry
- ‚úÖ Omnidrive with high-speed motors


## üß† Algorithm Development
Kinematics of the drive have been solved extensively, and odometry calculations are also available.<br>
Both of these will be implemented.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Project Timeline
The project timeline is divided into two halves:
1. <h3>Remote Based Drive with Odometry</h3>
2. <h3>Coordinate Based Drive using Odometry</h3>
A detailed breakup of these shall be discussed internally.
